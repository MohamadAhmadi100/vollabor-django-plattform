Simply select a region of interest in any scan (currently we work with lung CTs), and SEARCH immediately provides reference cases based on visual disease pattern detection, statistics, and medical literature necessary for differential diagnosis. Currently when a radiologist needs additional information to make a diagnosis, they must consult reference books, text-based search engines or wait to discuss with colleagues. SEARCH allows the radiologist to obtain all that information directly from the image itself, shortening their search time from 20 min to 2 sec. TRIAGE is another tool designed to save time during clinical routine. By automatically detecting disease patterns as soon as a scan is taken, TRIAGE allows doctors to better prioritize patients based on critical need. Both tools search for disease patterns that are present in COVID-19, and SEARCH provides distribution heatmaps of these patterns, which may be helpful during image interpretation.
