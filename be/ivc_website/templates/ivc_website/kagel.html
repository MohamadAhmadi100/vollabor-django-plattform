                        A team was sent from TECVICO to participate in this competition. The following is an explanation
                        of the competition topic and the performance of the TECVICO team.
                        Competition Description
                        Five times more deadly than the flu, COVID-19 causes significant morbidity and mortality. Like
                        other pneumonia, a lung infection with COVID-19 leads to inflammation and fluid in the lungs.
                        COVID-19 looks very similar to other viral and bacterial pneumonia on chest x-rays, making it
                        difficult to diagnose. Their computer vision model to detect and localize COVID-19 would help
                        doctors make a quick and safe diagnosis. This would allow patients to get the right treatment
                        before the virus' most serious effects occur. Currently, COVID-19 can be diagnosed using a
                        polymerase chain reaction to detect genetic material from the virus or a chest x-ray. However,
                        it can take a few hours and sometimes days for the molecular test results to come back. In
                        contrast, chest x-rays can be taken in minutes. While there are guidelines to help radiologists
                        differentiate COVID-19 from other types of infection, their assessments vary.

                In addition, non-radiologists could be supported in better localizing the disease, for example with a
                visual bounding box. As the leading healthcare organization in its field, the Society for Imaging
                Informatics in Medicine (SIIM) aims to advance medical imaging informatics through education, research
                and innovation. SIIM has partnered with the Valencia Region Health and Biomedical Research Foundation
                (FISABIO), the Valencia Region Medical Imaging Database (BIMCV) and the Radiological Society of North
                America (RSNA) for this competition. In this competition, it will identified and located COVID-19
                anomalies on chest x-rays. Specifically, categorize the x-rays as negative for pneumonia or typical,
                indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19. The proposed model work with imaging data and annotations from
                a group of radiologists. If successful, it will help radiologists diagnose the millions of COVID-19
                patients more safely and quickly. This also helps doctors understand the severity of the condition and
                make treatment decisions. Depending on the severity, affected patients may need hospitalization,
                admission to an intensive care unit, or supportive therapies such as mechanical ventilation. With a
                better diagnosis, more patients will quickly get the best care for their condition, which could mitigate
                the most serious effects of the virus.

            <p>
                In TECVICO, our team consists of three groups. First group worked on preprocessing of data which it was
                the x-ray images of lung belong to the patients. The other groups as image classification and object
                detection had the tasks for predictions of both a study (multi-image) and image level. In the study
                level task, classification of the x-ray images done for prediction of labels which may contain more than
                one label. They are as follows: "negative", "typical", "indeterminate", "atypical". In the image level
                task, detection of the desired object as “opacity” with a confidence score and bounding box should be
                predicted. The final result of our team was the accuracy of 0.597 vs 0.635 as top result of leaderboard
                in this challenge and got the 235 rank between 1305 teams. Here is the link to the leaderboard of the
