                        <p style="font-size:24px;">There are two kinds of ways to define new projects in TECVICO company:

                            i)	The projects that a supervisor defines 
                            ii)	The projects that are defined by somebody else (there is no main supervisor for this kinds of projects)
                            When a new project is defined, a project expert will be associated with it by TECVICO. The following diagram shows the procedure for defining a new project at TECVICO.

Next, you must apply for this position. Thus, there are some reequipments such a Ph.D. degree, strong resume etc. to apply for this position.

                                all researchers initially need to apply for this sector and after working in this sector
                                and being qualified (obtaining Responsiveness Fee and Badges) they can join other
                                sectors. The main goal of this sector is to find new challenges and scientifically
                                tackle them. The main outcome of this sector is journal and conference publications.
                                Besides focusing on research projects and publications, this sector works with interns
                                to train them for their future careers.

                                    <strong>Tecvico</strong> (Technological Virtual Collaboration) is a Canadian

                                    founded in Vancouver in 2020. It aims to facilitate the connection between industry
                                    and researchers/experts. Tecvico headquarter is located in Canada, and its
                                    researchers are collaborating virtually from different countries, such as Portugal,
                                    Iran, Canada, Germany, India, and other countries.
                                    All levels of researchers (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) can join Tecvico
                                    and apply for projects. Current projects are mainly defined in the fields of
                                    Artificial Intelligence such as Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep
                                    Learning. In addition, Tecvico is interested to work in other areas, such as
                                    Cryptography, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, etc.
                                    There are three components to each project:
                                    • Response points
                                    • Experience points
                                    •Financial value
                                    To enter the project, individuals must have earned response points and experience
                                    points required for the project. Response points can be earned by cooperating in
                                    other activities of the company or by making a financial commitment to the company.
                                    Experience points are earned based on your resume and interview and the activities
                                    you do at the company.
                                    The outputs of a project are the response score, the experience score, and the
                                    amount of the project budget, which is divided proportionally among the people
                                    participating in the project.
                                    If the project has another product such as an article, the points obtained from it
                                    will be awarded to its participants.

                                Entry permissions are entry permits for projects. They are divided into two main

                                This indicates how much a member was responsible for projects that he/she already
                                attended. It contains various aspects, such as attending all weekly meetings, being
                                on-time to deliver a task, being responsible for his/her words and behavior, etc.
                                Depending on the responsibility of researchers in different projects, they are assigned
                                points by projects' supervisors. These points could be converted to Responsiveness Fee.
                                If a researcher cannot afford to pay Responsiveness Fee, he/she can work for TECVICO as
                                an intern or a trial member for a while and after gaining enough points, he/she can join
                                a project.

                                use their skills and knowledge to proceed on a project, they are given points. These
                                points are given by supervisors. Based on these points, researchers are awarded Badges.
                                These Badges cannot be traded, and are only acquired through projects. They play a
                                crucial role in getting into Competition and Industry projects. If a member wants more

                                   defined in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Image Processing,
                                   Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. In addition,

                                    It contains various aspects, such as attending all weekly meetings, being on-time to deliver
                                    a task, being responsible for his/her words and behavior, etc. Depending on the responsibility
                                    of supervisors in different projects, they are assigned points by the company.
                                    These points are convert-able to Responsiveness Coins.
                                    These coins have financial value and can be bought/sold. 
                                    The applicants basically need responsibility and knowledge coins to apply for these projects.
                                    There are 3 ways to obtain responsibility coins as follows: i) 
                                    initial fee ($) to buy the coins, ii) work in some sections of the
                                    company and responsibility coins will be paid the applicant as his/her wage, and iii)
                                    corporate in projects and receive the coins as reward toward accomplishing the project.
                                    In fact, this kind of coin evaluates and motivates members to attend in all weekly meetings,
                                    be on-time to do assigned tasks, be responsible for his/her words and behavior etc.
                                    The applicants will be provided with knowledge coins via i) scientific interview, and ii) 
                                    accomplishing and promoting his/her knowledge in the project.

                                Entry permissions are entry permits for projects. They are divided into two main
                                classes:

                               Projects basically are referred to this section. Some time,
                               small industrial projects will also be associated with this section.
                               To join TECVICO, all applicants must apply for some projects in this section unless
                               they are able to receive a minimum knowledge coin via the interview process.
                               After passing this section and qualifying (obtaining responsibility and knowledge coins),
                               applicants can join other sections. TECVICO invites international laboratories, university professors, 
                               industry companies, governments, factories etc. to give the project to us. In Particular,
                               we will provide the university professors and lab supervisors with experts. As it is obvious,
                               the professors are undertaking some big projects from industries or governments.
                               They divide the project into smaller parts and then hire some students and researchers to do it.
                               The divisions most often include various fields or interdisciplinary projects,
                               and the lab members might not be expert in some fields. In this case,
                               the supervisor can give a section of the project to TECVICO. Thus
                               , TECVICO promises to provide the project with experts and lead it to be accomplished. Sometimes,
                               a project is assigned to a researcher/student and s/he is not able to accomplish it. In this case,
                               TECVICO can collaborate with the lab and provide the group with a professional teammate.
                               After completing the project, the members will be provided with i) responsibility coins, ii)
                               knowledge coins, and iii) wage ($) (if the project was already funded). If the project also results in an article,
                               the members will be considered as the authors based on their effort and supervisor’s/company’s rule.

                                Experienced scientists with high academic degrees
                                can be considered supervisors. Supervisors must 
                                hire and lead the members to accomplish the projects.
                                They must also present a proposal to get the project or define a research project.
                                TECVICO will invite these supervisors to review proposals, the papers, reports, etc.

                            <p >
                                TECVICO considers an experienced supervisor as a contractor.
                                Supervisors can define some projects in the project section.
                                These supervisors must present a proposal and then TECVICO will evaluate the proposal.
                                If the result of evaluation is positive, the supervisor can start the project via spending some responsibility and knowledge coins.
                                Applicants can also apply for these projects via spending their mentioned coins. Some projects can be funded via some industrial companies,
                                hospitals etc. at the beginning of the project or during doing the project. Thus, these projects are called funded projects
                                . Small industrial projects are associated with the project section.
                                Supervisors can also apply for these projects via presenting proposals. Finally,
                                the supervisor is able to undertake the project via company’s approval.
                                Meanwhile, the new projects will be noticed via member dashboard or news section or social media.

                                 When a new project is defined, the research project will be sent to the research director.
The research director must decide whether to accept or reject the supervisor’s proposal.
If the director accepts the proposal, she/he must assign an expert to the project and grant required permissions to the expert.
Now, the expert must accept the director’s request to undertake a research project.
The expert must send the proposal to at least 2 reviewers. After reviewing the proposal, the expert can see the reviewer's comments and evaluations.
If the project has been accepted, the expert must send a contract to the supervisor and follow it up.

If the project has been accepted, the project supervisor will receive the contract in his/her corresponding panel as follows:
