                        TECVICO is an international company that aims to facilitate the connection
                        between researchers worldwide. Thus, it obtains an international platform
                        to define the research project. Experienced researchers, university professors,
                        industrial companies, laboratories, and others can define and fund the project
                        on this platform, and other researchers<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2" style="display:none"> are able to observe and participate in
                            the projects. Moreover, all levels of scientists (beginner, intermediate,
                            or advanced) can join TECVICO and undertake a part of projects. Company experts
                            and research director first evaluate all projects. These projects are sent to
                            at least two reviewers for final evaluation. An expert is associated with each
                            research project and follows it to accomplish. The company provides the projects
                            with services such as GPU, Powerful database, algorithms, programs, and others.
                            TECVICO evaluates researchers and determines some badges for them. Each researcher
                            with a higher badge has more chance to be accepted via the project's main supervisor.
                            In short, TECVICO provides experts with international projects as well as industrial
                            projects with international experts. Moreover, it facilitates and accelerates finding
                            appropriate international collaborators for research projects that need teammates.
                            At least two reviewers will evaluate the projects before submitting them to journals
                            and conferences or delivering them to the clients. Thus, quality assurance checks
                            enable the production of high-quality products.</span>

                            TECVICO is interested in working on other fields, such as Cryptography, Electrical,

                            responsibility of supervisors in different projects, they are assigned points by the
                            company. These points are convert-able to Responsiveness Coins. These coins have

                            the lab members might not be expert in some fields. In this case, the supervisor can
                            give a section of project to TECVICO. Thus, TECVICO promises to provide the project with
                            experts and lead it to be accomplished. Some time, a project is assigned a
                            researcher/student and s/he is not able to accomplish it. In this case, TECVICO can
                            collaborate with the lab and provide the group with a professional teammate. After being
                            accomplished the project, the members will be provided with i) responsibility coins, ii)
                            knowledge coins, and iii) wage ($) (if the project was already funded). If the project
                            also results in an article, the members will be considered as the authors based on their

                            1. Responsiveness Fee (Res Fee): This indicates how much a member was responsible for
                            projects that he/she already attended. It contains various aspects, such as attending
                            all weekly meetings, being on-time to deliver a task, being responsible for his/her
                            words and behavior, etc. Depending on the responsibility of researchers in different
                            projects, they are assigned points by projects' supervisors. These points are
                            convert-able to Responsiveness Fee. If a researcher cannot afford to pay Responsiveness
                            Fee, he/she can work for TECVICO as an intern or a trial member for a while and after
                            gaining enough points, he/she can join a project.

                            2. Badges: This Badges shows how much a member knows a subject and how much he/she is
                            skilled in programming, using tools and software. Depending on how much members were
                            successful to use their skills and knowledge to proceed on a project, they are given
                            points. These points are given by supervisors. Based on these points, researchers are
                            awarded Badges. These Badges cannot be traded, and are only acquired through projects.
                            They play a crucial role in getting into Competition and Industry projects. If a member
                            wants more Res Fee to join projects with more funds, it is recommended to choose
                            projects that suit his/her abilities and complete them in the best possible way.
